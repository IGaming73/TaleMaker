# Tale Maker : A PyQt5 Demo

![TaleMaker interface](https://cloud-fu32vtbfw-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

With this **simple Python app**, you can **create your own story** by choosing the name of the hero!

This app was **intended to be pretty basic**, as it serves as a **well commented demo** on **how to use the main widgets from the Python PyQt5 package**, by showcasing how to use different kind of texts, images, buttons, drop-down menus, text inputs, and even web displays (by displaying a YouTube video here) and file selectors.

**Feel free to customize this app** as much as you want if you want to **learn PyQt5 and UIs in Python!**

This project will be build from scratch in the [**HackClub Python GUI Workshop**](https://events.hackclub.com/python-gui-workshop/), so **don't miss it if you're interested!**
